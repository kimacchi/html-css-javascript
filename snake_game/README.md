This is the first project where I just sat down and said "I want to make this" and actually have done it completely on my own.

Although, for the same reason, it lacks in a lot of aspects. I have gotten a few feedbacks from my friends, although they are either about design or the hardness of the game.

I will try to update the game from time to time, trying to implement new things i learn or new alghoritms i come up with.


here is a live demo: https://snakegame-jade.vercel.app/

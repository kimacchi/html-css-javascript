# html-css-javascript

these codes are just the beginning of my Javascript-HTML-CSS and in a wider aspect, my Web Developement journey. I know this isn't much, but it's at least a start. My foreseeable plan and wish is that one day, I could return back to this repository and see all those little things I did when i first started. I wish to see that said one day.
